Motivation
==========

Waltman and Eck (2015) demonstrate that whole counting is incompatible with field normalization. They propose fractional counting on the level of authors implemented by fractional counting on address strings.

In any such approach two issues arise:

1.  Several authors might be affiliated to the same organisation
2.  Single authors might be affiliated with several organisations

Example:

``` sql
SELECT fk_authors, fk_institutions, type, role, organization1, countrycode
FROM wos_b_2018.items it
LEFT JOIN wos_b_2018.items_authors_institutions iai ON it.pk_items = iai.fk_items
LEFT JOIN wos_b_2018.institutions inst ON inst.pk_institutions = iai.fk_institutions
WHERE ut_eid = '000262133500009'
```

Potential Solution
==================

Fractional counting based on author attribution and subsequent aggregation to the levle of interest (here: countries) might be computed as follows:

``` sql
SELECT fk_items, countrycode, SUM(orga_frak) AS cntry_frac -- aggregating on country level
FROM( -- aggregating on organization1 level
    SELECT fk_items, organization1, countrycode, SUM(orga_share)  AS orga_frak
    FROM( -- computing fractional contribution of organsation on author level
      SELECT DISTINCT fk_items, organization1, countrycode, fk_authors,
        (1/(COUNT (DISTINCT fk_authors) OVER (PARTITION BY fk_items))) / 
        (COUNT (DISTINCT organization1) OVER (PARTITION BY fk_items, fk_authors)) AS orga_share
      FROM wos_b_2018.items it
      JOIN wos_b_2018.items_authors_institutions iai ON it.pk_items = iai.fk_items
      JOIN wos_b_2018.institutions inst ON inst.pk_institutions = iai.fk_institutions
      WHERE ut_eid = '000262133500009'
        AND role = 'author'
        AND type = 'RS'
      )
    GROUP BY fk_items, organization1, countrycode
)
GROUP BY fk_items, countrycode
```

|  FK\_ITEMS| COUNTRYCODE |  CNTRY\_FRAC|
|----------:|:------------|------------:|
|   28825338| ITA         |        0.125|
|   28825338| CZE         |        0.750|
|   28825338| MEX         |        0.125|

The *KB* versions of *Web of Science* and *Scopus* differ in their usage of *fk\_authors*, *type* and *role* (Why?). WoS holds the same *fk\_authors* as a corresponding author (*RP*) and as an ordinary author (*RS*), while SCP assigns two different *fk\_authors* for the same author which vary in their type (*RP* or *RS*). In any case entries for corresponding authors have to excluded via the *RP* type. Furthermore in the WoS authors have to be separated from other roles via *role = 'author'*.

Data Quality
============

Necessary information in variables like *Organization1*, *role* and *type* might not always be available and especially before 2008 the link between authors (*fk\_authors*) and their affiliated organisation (*fk\_institutions*) was most often only recorded for the corresponding author.

Percentages of pk\_items with partially missing information:

Implementation
==============

Due to large shares of items with incomplete information we propose a hybrid spproach. We (1) fractionalize on the author level (and subsequently aggregate to the country level) for every pk\_item with complete information in the *items\_authors\_institutions* table and (2) apply fractionalization on the organisation level (and therefore ignore any authors) via *organization1* for all other pk\_items. Hence we follow Waltman and Eck (2015) but account for data quality issues at the same time.

In detail we compute a table which holds country specific weights for fractional counting. Lower aggregates levels like organisations might also be computed.

``` sql
DROP TABLE items_iai_complete;
DROP TABLE wosb2018_frc_cntrylvl;

/*

*/
CREATE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE items_iai_complete (
    fk_items NUMBER

ON COMMIT DELETE ROWS;

CREATE TABLE wosb2018_frc_cntrylvl (
    fk_items NUMBER,
    countrycode VARCHAR2(10 CHAR),
    frac_share NUMBER(3,2),
    ind_complete NUMBER(1,0)
);

/*

INSERT INTO items_iai_complete (
SELECT DISTINCT tmp.fk_items -- subset of items with complete iai information

```

Caveats
=======

-   Whenever an authors holds several affiliations of which two or more actually describe the same organisation, but have not been cleaned in *organization1*, we assign erroneous weights. This issue might be less severe on a country level analysis and could ultimately only be resolved via a worldwide institution harmonization.
-   Affiliations without an *organzation1* are omitted, e.g. private addresses (1,2% in wos\_b\_2018)
-   anonymous authors (*role = 'anon'*) are omitted
-   Any other?

Comparison with ISI fractionation on organization1
==================================================

As an alternative implementation we also compute weights based on fractionation on the *organization1* level:

``` sql

/*
create empty table defining fractional weight for every paper by country
based on fractionation on organization1 level
*/
CREATE TABLE wosb2018_frc_cntrylvl_org1 (
    fk_items NUMBER,
    countrycode VARCHAR2(10 CHAR),
    frac_share NUMBER(3,2)
);

/*
include items with INCOMPLETE iai information via fractional counting on organization level:
*/
INSERT INTO wosb2018_frc_cntrylvl_org1
SELECT fk_items, countrycode, SUM(orga_frak) AS frac_share -- aggregating on country level
FROM( -- aggregating on organization1 level
    SELECT fk_items, organization1, countrycode, SUM(orga_share)  AS orga_frak
    FROM( -- computing fractional contribution on organisation level
      SELECT DISTINCT fk_items, ORGANIZATION1, countrycode,
        (1/(COUNT (DISTINCT organization1) OVER (PARTITION BY fk_items))) AS orga_share
      FROM wos_b_2018.items it
      JOIN wos_b_2018.ITEMS_AUTHORS_INSTITUTIONS iai ON it.pk_items = iai.fk_items
      JOIN wos_b_2018.institutions inst ON inst.pk_institutions = iai.fk_institutions
      WHERE pubtype = 'Journal'
        AND doctype IN ('Article', 'Review')
        AND pubyear BETWEEN 2007 AND 2017
        AND (role = 'author' OR role IS NULL)
        AND type = 'RS'
        AND organization1 IS NOT NULL
      )
    GROUP BY fk_items, organization1, countrycode
)
GROUP BY fk_items, countrycode;

CREATE INDEX wosb2018_frc_cntrylvl_org1_ix ON wosb2018_frc_cntrylvl_org1 (fk_items, countrycode);

COMMIT;

Scopus: scopus\_b\_2017
=======================

Data quality seems to be better in Scopus. However, the field *organization1* is not as much structured in Scopus as in WoS, consequently as an alternative one could consider to use the Scopus institution harmonization *AFID* in the Rohdatenbank instead of *organization1*. However an uniformly detailed affiliation assignment in *organization1* might not have substantial effects on country statistics, while the *pk\_kb\_inst* should jointly for all German institution include several of these detailied sub-organization affiliations and consequently validate a relative comparison among German institutions.

Percentages of pk\_items with partially missing information (Scopus):

Summing up
==========

The implications of the adapted counting method seems rather minor on the chosen analysis level of countries.

Fractionation on the author level relies on complete information on the affiliations of single authors.

In the WoS the share of items with incomplete records constantly constitutes a substantial part of the corpus. Although data quality has strongly improved since 2008, still for 2017 more than 10% of all articles and reviews are incomplete. Furthermore data quality apparently gets improved every year, but the rate of improvement has slowed down considerably in the last years.

Socpus holds less incomplete recods, their share has been below 10% for all years since the first observation year 2007.

Consequently fractionizing on the author level seems only reasonable on complete records, whereas incomplete records might be fractionoized on the *organization1* level. Both approaches could be improved via a wordwide institution harmonization, which has partially be done by ISI Karlsruhe for their EFI reports.

Appendix
========

KB institution encoding
-----------------------

Fractionation weights are computed at the organiazation1 level (either with prior fractionation at the author level or due to incomplete information only on the organization1 level) and then transferred to the corresponding pk\_kb\_inst via the fk\_institutions link. Consequently we assume that every pk\_kb\_inst constitutes a superset of organization1.
